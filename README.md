# PocketPatch Plaid Transactions Classifier

This is the code for a transaction classifier, experimentally being used for
[PocketPatch](https://pocketpatch.io). This repo is not the actual source being
used for deployment because some limitations with the hosting platform, but it
is the same code.

There is nothing novel about the code itself, but I wrote
[a post](https://perezperret.com/practical-machine-learning-and-rails) about the
more interesting parts (especially how it connects to Ruby on Rails).
